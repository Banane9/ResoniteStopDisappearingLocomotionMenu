Stop Disappearing Locomotion Menu
=================================

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://Resonite.com/) that
can prevent the locomotion and scale items from disappearing from the context menu while holding a tool.  
Scale can be toggled as a sub-option of the locomotion item being shown.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [StopDisappearingLocomotionMenu.dll](https://github.com/Banane9/ResoniteStopDisappearingLocomotionMenu/releases/latest/download/StopDisappearingLocomotionMenu.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
